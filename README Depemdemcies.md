It would be necessary to add the dependencies for PHPMailer and google-api-php-client-main. For this purpose, I provide the GitHub links to perform the pull request.
To ensure the dependencies work correctly, download the repositories as ZIP files from GitHub, extract them, and place the folders at the same directory level as the PHP files.

PHPMailer:
https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer

Google PHP Client:
https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client
